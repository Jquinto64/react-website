    "bio":"As an aspiring biomedical engineer, I'm passionate about using machine learning tools to innovate healthcare and the world at large. This past co-op term, I worked at PerkinElmer Inc, where I helped develop an AI solution for drug discovery. In the summer of 2018, I interned with Sunnybrook's Focused Ultrasound group to help develop treatments for cancer and dementia patients. The following year, I became a summer student at the Schulich Heart Centre, where I co-authored a paper on using MRI to diagnosing heart arrhythmias.",

I then implemented a deep learning architecture that reduced the number of features from 5000 to 150, while improving model accuracy from 91% to 96%. Lastly, I used model interpretability algorithms to identify biological relationships between features. Technologies Used: SciKit-Learn, Keras, PyTorch, SHAP, Captum"

He consistently delivered excellent quality of work while coming up with creative solutions for feature selection using machine learning. John was extremely driven and self-motivated to research and explore unfamiliar architectures to solve our problem, all with minimal guidance. I was very impressed with his diligence, initiative and his ability to take ownership of his work and I could always count on him to find a solution regardless of the challenges or limitations faced. John was an absolute pleasure to work with and I highly recommend him for any research or engineering role in machine learning or software development.",
