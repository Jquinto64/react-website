    "bio":"As an aspiring AI developer, I'm passionate about using machine learning tools to innovate the world at large. This past co-op term, I worked at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), where I used deep learning to predict precipitation type from time series data. I also worked at PerkinElmer Inc, where I helped develop an AI solution for drug discovery. In the summer of 2018, I interned with Sunnybrook's Focused Ultrasound group to help develop treatments for cancer and dementia patients. The following year, I became a summer student at the Schulich Heart Centre, where I co-authored a paper on using MRI to diagnosing heart arrhythmias.",

I also implemented a feature selection method that cut computation times from 6 hours to 10 minutes, while reducing the error of an XGBoost ensemble by 6%. Moreover, I developed a CNN-based facial recognition and face clustering pipeline that identified unique participants in the training and testing datasets with an accuracy of 99.8%. Lastly, I used the unique participants from the face clustering pipeline to design a bias correction procedure that decreased model RMSE by an average of 18% per participant.

I designed GRU and LSTM models to infer precipitation type from time series atmospheric data, improving classification accuracy from 66% to 91%. I also built a regression model to predict snowfall from time series temperature data, which was applied to 7620 stations across North America. All of this involved writing data cleaning and data visualization scripts for 4 meteorological datasets, each comprising over 1 million data points.
